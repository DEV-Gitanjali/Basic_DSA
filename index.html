    // question:-1     sum of two integer 
    // question:-2    relation between two integer and string
    let  a = 10;
    let b = 5;
    // console.log("sum of 10 and 20 is " + a + b);  
    // answer is "sum of 10 and 20 is 105" because + operator concatenates the strings from left to right.
    console.log("sum of 10 and 20 is " + (a + b));  // answer is "sum of 10 and 20 is 15" because parentheses have higher precedence.
    
    // question:-3  -type  coercion
    // --> type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another (such as strings to numbers).
     console.log("1"- 1);  // answer is 0 because - operator converts string "1" to number 1 before subtraction.
     console.log("1"+ 1);  // answer is "11" because + operator concatenates string "1" and number 1.

      console.log("five" - 2); // answer is NaN because "five" cannot be converted to a number.

      // question:-4  -  type casting
      let age = Number(prompt("Enter your age:")); // type casting string input to number
      console.log(typeof age); // answer is number because we used Number() to cast the input
      console.log(typeof age); // answer is string because prompt returns a string. 

      // question:-5  -  swap to variables via methods 

      let x = 10;
      let y = 20;
       let temp;

      temp = x;
      x=y;
      y=temp;
      console.log("after swapping x:", x); // answer is 20
      console.log("after swapping y:", y); // answer is 10

    
      // swap the variables without using a temporary variable
      let p = 30;
      let q = 40;   
       p =  p  + q;
       q= p-q;
       p = p - q;
       console.log("after swapping p:", p); // answer is 40 
        console.log("after swapping q:", q); // answer is 30
    // swap using destructuring assignment (ES6 feature)
    let m = 50;
    let n = 60;     
    [m, n] = [n, m];
    console.log( m , n); // answer is 60 50
